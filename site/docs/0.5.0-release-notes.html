<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<p>
  This release is very exciting for the massive performance
  improvements and improvements for handling large amounts of data;
  primarily through a port of key code from Node.js to Go. If you have
  tried out DataStation before and were frustrated at slow run times,
  consider trying it again with this release.

<h3>Fast panel evaluation via Go port</h3>
<p>
  The primary change in this release is that the panel evaluation code
  has been mostly ported to Go. This reduces the eliminates the 8-12
  second overhead (especially on Windows) when running even simple
  program and literal panels. The panel evaluation overhead
  (initialization of libraries, etc.) is less than 1 second now.
</p>
<p>
  Since existing integration tests applied to the Go code covers many
  cases, there is reason to believe that even this drastic and fast of
  a rewrite is generally ok. However, it is a rewrite so there's
  always a greater than usual risk of bugs. If you prefer stability,
  stick with 0.4.0 for now. If you want performance, try this release
  out.
</p>
<h3>Up to 15x faster remote file reads</h3>
<p>
  Remote files are now compressed with gzip before copying/reading (if
  gzip is available on the remote machine). For a 100mb file this
  brought down total ingest time from 60 seconds to 4 seconds.
</p>
<h3>SQLite for SQL program panel engine</h3>
<p>
  Before this release, DataStation
  used <a href="https://github.com/agershun/alasql">AlaSQL</a> as the
  SQL engine for the SQL program panel. This implementation (and/or
  the DataStation wrapper code around it) could not handle ingesting
  more than 4MB of data. This case arises when you have a large file
  and you want to run SQL over it: <code>SELECT COUNT(1) FROM
  DM_getPanel('some large panel')</code>.
</p>
<p>
  But in this release the engine has been swiched to SQLite which has
  been tested to be able to handle ingesting at least 500MB of data.
  This is a breaking change since AlaSQL has some PostgreSQL features
  like the <code>col::TEXT</code> cast syntax that is not ANSI SQL.
</p>
<h3>Large file shape analysis</h3>
<p>
  Many panels would crash after ingesting more than 4MB of data just
  while trying to get shape and preview information. This release
  introduces a partial JSON parser (dedicated blog post on this to
  come) that reads only a small amount of initial data (for example at
  most 100KB of data) and does shape and preview analysis based on
  that partial JSON data.
</p>
<h3>Standalone CLI for SQL queries on JSON, CSV, Parquet, etc.</h3>
<p>
  The port to Go also made it easier to build a small CLI on top of
  existing DataStation behavior. You can
  install <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/tree/main/runner/cmd/dsq">dsq</a>
  on your laptop or server and use it to run SQL queries on every kind
  of file that DataStation supports. It does not require the full
  DataStation app to run.
</p>
<p>
  For example if you have a CSV file with user information, you can
  run <code>dsq users.csv "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM {}"</code>
  to count all the distinct names in your users.csv file. Under the
  hood dsq uses SQLite for queries just like the rest of DataStation.
</p>
<p>
  You can read more about dsq in
  its <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/tree/main/runner/cmd/dsq">README</a>.
</p>
<h3>Improvements to automated testing</h3>
<p>
  This release adds additional automated integration testing for
  SQLite, SQL Server, and Oracle database panels; file panels over
  SSH; HTTP panels over SSH; and file panels reading log data (like
  Apache access logs). The integration tests for databases works by
  running entire databases (including Oracle and SQL Server) in
  containers in Github Actions so that real queries can be run against
  the real databases.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, this release improves on JavaScript (frontend and
  backend) line coverage at around 68% and Go line coverage at around
  72%.
