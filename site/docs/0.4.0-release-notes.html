<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<h3>UI Updates (and dark mode)</h3>
<p>
  The primary change in this release is an updated UI and a dark
  mode. You can try out both in in
  the <a href="https://app.datastation.multiprocess.io/">online
  demo</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The desktop app dark mode setting is turned on by editing the JSON
  file `~/DataStationProjects/.settings`, adding `"theme": "dark"`
  to the top level, and restarting DataStation.

<h2>Confirmed processing files up to 512mb</h2>
<p>
  DataStation can now definitely process individual files up to 512mb
  in size and likely much larger. Exactly how much larger has not yet
  been tested.
</p>
<p>
  There were two limiting factors here. One was the size of a single
  string in Node.js. This was fixed by writing array data out to files
  element-at-a-time rather than <code>JSON.stringify</code>-ing the
  entire array once. The other limiting factor was discovering the
  shape of large files. This was fixed by building a partial-JSON
  parser that stops reading a file after a certain number of bytes and
  closes all open arrays/objects to create a valid JSON object.
