<p>
  File panels allow you to read files from disk. Every time the panel
  is run the file is read again (except for in the online
  environment).
</p>
<h2>With Server</h2>
<p>
  You can read files from remote servers with an SSH tunnel by
  checking the <code>With Server</code> option. Once selected, you
  will be prompted to pick from one of
  the <a href="/docs/ssh-connection.html">SSH Connections</a> you set
  up previously.
</p>
<h2>Online Environment Caveats</h2>
<p>
  In the online environment the browser won't allow us to remember the
  file you've selected or read it again without you reselecting it. So
  it is only read once when you pick a file.
</p>
<p>
  Re-running the panel will not cause it to be re-read. And reloading
  the page will cause it to be forgotten until you select the file
  again.
</p>
<p>
  You cannot read files over SSH in this mode.
