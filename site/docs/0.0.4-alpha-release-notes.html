<h2>Features and improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>File, HTTP and Literal panels</h3>
    <h4>New log parsers</h4>
    <p>
      You can now override the content type of content panels and
      select from a number of useful builtin parsers (in addition to
      Excel, CSV, JSON): JSON newline, Apache2 error and access logs,
      Nginx access logs, Syslog logs, or specify a custom regex to
      apply to each line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Upshot?</strong> In addition to just being able to
      import logs for joining with other datasets, you can now use
      DataStation as a primitive alternative to a Splunk or ELK setup
      for working with your logs.
    </p>
    <h4>Importing Parquet content</h4>
    <p>
      DataStation can now read Parquet files from File and HTTP
      panels. (Since it's a binary format it won't work in the Literal
      panel which is plain-text.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Upshot?</strong> By importing a Parquet file or hitting
      an HTTP endpoint returning Parquet, you can use DataStation to
      run SQL queries against your Parquet data by adding a SQL Code
      panel reading from the File or HTTP panel.
    </p>
    <h4>Improvements to Excel importing</h4>
    <p>
      Excel files now only import the actual sheets rather than all
      metadata about the Excel file. Additionally, when there is only
      one sheet in the Excel file, the result of the panel is
      flattened down as if you imported a CSV of that single sheet
      (rather than the result being a dictionary mapping sheet name to
      CSV-like result). Finally, DataStation will automatically trim
      whitespace in Excel column headers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Program and SQL panels</h3>
    <h4>Cancel running processes</h4>
    <p>
      Before this release you could not cancel a running process. This
      meant it was impossible to debug an infinite loop a Program
      panel. In this release you can now hit Pause after running a
      program to kill the running process.
    </p>
    <h4>SQLite</h4>
    <p>
      You can now query SQLite databases, locally or remote.
    </p>
    <h4>In-memory SQL</h4>
    <p>
      By switching
      from <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js">sql.js</a>
      (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly)
      to <a href="https://github.com/agershun/alasql">alasql</a>
      DataStation can now handle running over much larger
      results. WebAssembly in contrast seems to have very tight
      restrictions on how much memory it is able to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the in-memory SQL panel has moved from the SQL
      panel into the Program panel since it's more like a script than
      a connection to a real database.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Upshot?</strong> You can now run SQL queries against
      at least 10s of megabytes of data.
    </p>
    <h4>CockroachDB</h4>
    <p>
      This release confirms support for querying CockroachDB databases
      by setting up a PostgreSQL connection pointed at your
      CockroachDB database.
    </p>
    <h4>More useful in-memory Python for online environment</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="https://brython.info/">Brython was the original
      in-memory Python implementation used in the online
      environment. It is small and efficient but wraps all native
      Python objects in a way that makes it very inconvenient to
      use. This release swaps out Brython
      for <a href="https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide">Pyodide</a> to
      make the in-memory Python experience as easy as you'd expect.
    </p>
  </li>

    <h3>General panel improvements</h3>
    <h4>Panel success/failure</h4>
    <p>
      When a panel is running, its background will oscillate between a
      purple tinge and white. Additionally, "Success" or "Failure" is
      shown at the top of the panel near the play button in green or
      red.
    </p>
    <h4>Inferred shape of results</h4>
    <p>
      Thanks to
      a <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/shape">newly
      released open-source library</a> DataStation will show you an
      inferred schema for the results after you run a panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Upshot?</strong> In addition to making it easier to
      explore your own data, DataStation uses the shape of panels to
      make it easier to fill out other panels. For example, the Graph
      panel can now default to loading a Y-axis field that is a number
      and an X-axis field that is a string.
    </p>
    <h4>Additional results metadata</h4>
    <p>
      After a panel is run, DataStation will show you the assumed
      content-type used while parsing the results and will also show
      you the size in bytes, kilobytes, or megabytes of the result
      stored on disk.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Misc improvements</h3>
    <h4>Efficient results storage</h4>
    <p>
      Prior to this release, panel results were stored both on disk
      and in browser memory. In this release, results are no longer
      stored in browser memory. This keeps the UI fast as you load
      larger data into DataStation.
    </p>
    <h4>Run all panels on page</h4>
    <p>
      Each page now has a global run button that will trigger all
      panels to run in sequence top to bottom. This will only work if
      panels depend on panels above them.
    </p>
    <h4>Global undo</h4>
    <p>
      You can now use Ctrl- or Cmd- z to undo changes like deleting a
      page or panel.
    </p>
    <h4>Project improvements</h4>
    <p>
      You can now open multiple projects at the same time (in
      different windows). You can also create new projects if one
      already exists (a silly limitation before).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Test and release improvements</h3>
    <h4>End-to-end tests</h4>
    <p>
      End-to-end tests are now run automatically in Github Actions for
      Windows, Linux and macOS on amd64/x86_64.
    </p>
    <h4>Linux binaries</h4>
    <p>
      Pre-built Linux binaries are now provided in the release
      artifacts page on Github!
    </p>
    <h4>Automated release builds</h4>
    <p>
      Before this release, release artifacts were hand-built on
      different laptops. Now they are built and uploaded by Github
      Actions for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
