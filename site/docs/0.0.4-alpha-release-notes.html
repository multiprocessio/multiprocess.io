<h2>Features and improvements</h2>
<p>
  There is so much in this release it is difficult to summarize! Here
  are a few cool parts: you can now use DataStation like a rudimentary
  ELK or Splunk instance with its new log parsers. You can load larger
  data into DataStation due to a number of efficiency
  improvements. You can run SQL over much larger datasets due to a
  more efficient SQL implementation. And much more!
</p>
<p>
  Read on for details and screenshots.
</p>
<h3>File, HTTP and Literal panels</h3>
<h4>New log parsers</h4>
<p>
  You can now override the content type of content panels and
  select from a number of useful builtin parsers (in addition to
  Excel, CSV, JSON): JSON newline, Apache2 error and access logs,
  Nginx access logs, Syslog logs, or specify a custom regex to
  apply to each line.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Upshot?</strong> In addition to just being able to
  import logs for joining with other datasets, you can now use
  DataStation as a primitive alternative to a Splunk or ELK setup
  for working with your logs.

</p>
<h4>Importing Parquet content</h4>
<p>
  DataStation can now read Parquet files from File and HTTP
  panels. (Since it's a binary format it won't work in the Literal
  panel which is plain-text.)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Upshot?</strong> By importing a Parquet file or hitting
  an HTTP endpoint returning Parquet, you can use DataStation to
  run SQL queries against your Parquet data by adding a SQL Code
  panel reading from the File or HTTP panel.
</p>
<h4>Improvements to Excel importing</h4>
<p>
  Excel files now only import the actual sheets rather than all
  metadata about the Excel file. Additionally, when there is only
  one sheet in the Excel file, the result of the panel is
  flattened down as if you imported a CSV of that single sheet
  (rather than the result being a dictionary mapping sheet name to
  CSV-like result). Finally, DataStation will automatically trim
  whitespace in Excel column headers.
</p>
<h3>Program and SQL panels</h3>
<h4>Cancel running processes</h4>
<p>
  Before this release you could not cancel a running process. This
  meant it was impossible to debug an infinite loop a Program
  panel. In this release you can now hit Pause after running a
  program to kill the running process.

</p>
<h4>SQLite</h4>
<p>
  You can now query SQLite databases, locally or remote.
</p>
<h4>In-memory SQL</h4>
<p>
  By switching
  from <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js">sql.js</a>
  (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly)
  to <a href="https://github.com/agershun/alasql">alasql</a>
  DataStation can now handle running over much larger
  results. WebAssembly in contrast seems to have very tight
  restrictions on how much memory it is able to use.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, the in-memory SQL panel has moved from the SQL
  panel into the Program panel since it's more like a script than
  a connection to a real database.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Upshot?</strong> You can now run SQL queries against
  at least 10s of megabytes of data.
</p>
<h4>CockroachDB</h4>
<p>
  This release confirms support for querying CockroachDB databases
  by setting up a PostgreSQL connection pointed at your
  CockroachDB database.
</p>
<h4>More useful in-memory Python for online environment</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://brython.info/">Brython was the original
    in-memory Python implementation used in the online
    environment. It is small and efficient but wraps all native
    Python objects in a way that makes it very inconvenient to
    use. This release swaps out Brython
    for <a href="https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide">Pyodide</a> to
    make the in-memory Python experience as easy as you'd expect.
</p>
<h3>General panel improvements</h3>
<h4>Panel success/failure</h4>
<p>
  When a panel is running, its background will oscillate between a
  purple tinge and white. Additionally, "Success" or "Failure" is
  shown at the top of the panel near the play button in green or
  red.
</p>
<h4>Inferred shape of results</h4>
<p>
  DataStation will now show you an inferred schema for the results
  after you run a panel.  As it happens, the library powering this
  is also available
  on <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/shape">MultiProcess
    Github</a> for standalone use in JavaScript/Node.js programs.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Upshot?</strong> In addition to making it easier to
  explore your own data, DataStation uses the shape of panels to
  make it easier to fill out other panels. For example, the Graph
  panel can now default to loading a Y-axis field that is a number
  and an X-axis field that is a string.

</p>
<h4>Additional results metadata</h4>
<p>
  After a panel is run, DataStation will show you the assumed
  content-type used while parsing the results and will also show
  you the size in bytes, kilobytes, or megabytes of the result
  stored on disk.

</p>
<h3>Misc improvements</h3>
<h4>Efficient results storage</h4>
<p>
  Prior to this release, panel results were stored both on disk
  and in browser memory. In this release, results are no longer
  stored in browser memory. This keeps the UI fast as you load
  larger data into DataStation.
</p>
<h4>Run all panels on page</h4>
<p>
  Each page now has a global run button that will trigger all
  panels to run in sequence top to bottom. This will only work if
  panels depend on panels above them.
</p>
<h4>Global undo</h4>
<p>
  You can now use Ctrl- or Cmd- z to undo changes like deleting a
  page or panel.
</p>
<h4>Project improvements</h4>
<p>
  You can now open multiple projects at the same time (in
  different windows). You can also create new projects if one
  already exists (a silly limitation before).
</p>
<h3>Test and release improvements</h3>
<h4>End-to-end tests</h4>
<p>
  End-to-end tests are now run automatically in Github Actions for
  Windows, Linux and macOS on amd64/x86_64.
</p>
<h4>Linux binaries</h4>
<p>
  Pre-built Linux binaries are now provided in the release
  artifacts page on Github!
</p>
<h4>Automated release builds</h4>
<p>
  Before this release, release artifacts were hand-built on
  different laptops. Now they are built and uploaded by Github
  Actions for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
