<p>
  This release brings a smaller install size for the same
  functionality, an in-app settings editor, support for reading ODS
  and TSV files, and more bug fixes.

<h3>Release sizes shrunk 18-35%</h3>
<p>
  The macOS zip is down to 261Mb from 318Mb, the Windows zip is down
  to 112Mb from 172Mb, and the Linux zip is down to 249Mb from 338. It
  is likely that it will continue to shrink as the last remaining
  pieces of the Node.js runner are ported to Go (particularly
  Snowflake evaluation).
</p>
<h3>Modify settings in-app</h3>
<p>
  Before this release you had to edit a JSON file on disk to modify
  settings like Light Mode/Dark Mode. Now you can do that within the
  app. But you will need to restart the app for the changes to take
  effect. Settings are within the View desktop dropdown menu.

<h3>Scripting in PHP</h3>
<p>
  In addition to Python, JavaScript, Ruby, R and Julia you can also
  now script in PHP.

  spreadsheets) into DataStation in the File and HTTP Panels.

</ul>
