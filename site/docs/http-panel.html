<p>
  HTTP panels are for making HTTP requests. You can make GET, POST,
  PUT, HEAD, or DELETE requests.
</p>
<h2>With Server</h2>
<p>
  HTTP requests can be proxied through an SSH tunnel by checking
  the <code>With Server</code> option. Once selected, you will be
  prompted to pick from one of
  the <a href="/docs/ssh-connection.html">SSH Connections</a> you set
  up previously.
</p>
<h2>Online Environment Caveats</h2>
<p>
  In the online environment you can only make requests to servers that
  set <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS
  headers</a> since there is no server.
</p>
<p>
  You cannot proxy HTTP requests through an SSH tunnel in this mode.
