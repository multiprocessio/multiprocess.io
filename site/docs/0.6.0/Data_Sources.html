out a data source for external SQL servers like MySQL or PostgreSQL so
you can query them in a <a href="./Panels/Database_Panels.html">Database panel</a>.</p>
<h1>With Server</h1>
<p>A data source can be definied as being proxied through an SSH tunnel
by checking the <strong>With Server</strong> option. Once selected, you will be
prompted to pick from one of the <a href="./SSH_Connections.html">SSH connections</a> you set up
