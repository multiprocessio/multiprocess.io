{% raw %}<h1>Macros</h1>
<p>Not all panels operate on code where the <code class="hljs">DM_getPanel</code> builtin
function call is available. To work around this, DataStation allows
you to templatize any panel body (and sometimes other fields) using
Jinja-like macros. The primary purpose of these macros is to read some
panel results.</p>
<p>A panel's macros are evaluated when you run the panel. But they happen
before the panel's primary action. For example if you have macros in
an HTTP panel body, they are evaluated before submitting the request.</p>
<h1>DM_getPanel macro</h1>
<p>The primary thing you have access to in a macro is a <code class="hljs">DM_getPanel</code>
call. It's very similar to the non-macro <code class="hljs">DM_getPanel</code> call. The
difference is that all of the rows are always loaded into memory at
once. This makes macros not excellent for passing around massive
amounts of data.</p>
<p>Also, you can only pass strings to this macro function. You cannot do
<code class="hljs">{{ DM_getPanel(0) }}</code>. You must surround the argument with quotes.</p>
<h1>Iterating over panel results</h1>
<p>Here is an example macro referencing the first panel that is an array
of objects containing at least two fields: <code class="hljs">name</code> and <code class="hljs">age</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{% for row in DM_getPanel(&quot;0&quot;) %}{{ row.name }}: {{ row.age }}{% if not forloop.Last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}
</code></pre>
<h1>Converting a result to JSON</h1>
<p>If you want to convert a panel result to JSON you can use the <code class="hljs">json</code>
filter:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">{{ DM_getPanel(&quot;0&quot;) | json }}
</code></pre>
<h1>Macro language</h1>
<p>The underlying macro language is a Jinja-like language called
<a href="https://github.com/flosch/pongo2">Pongo2</a>. Check out their docs for
more details on what is available in this language.</p>
