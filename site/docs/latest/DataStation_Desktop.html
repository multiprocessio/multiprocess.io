{% raw %}<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>DataStation can run as either a desktop application or as a server
application. You will need to have an OIDC provider if you want to run
the server application. The server application comes with the ability
to run and email reports daily, weekly, or monthly. It also comes with
support for read-only dashboards.</p>
<h1>Desktop</h1>
<p>Pre-built binaries are provided for 64-bit x86 machines running macOS,
Windows, and Linux.</p>
<h2>MacOS</h2>

the application to click Open so you can run the untrusted

&quot;Don't run&quot;, click &quot;More info&quot; and click &quot;Run anyway&quot;. There may be a
few second long security scan the first time you run.</p>

<h2>Other</h2>
<p>Other systems and architectures may be supported but you will need to
build them yourself. Follow <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/blob/main/HACKING.html">instructions in the repo</a>.</p>
<h2>Light mode/Dark mode</h2>
<p>To toggle light or dark mode in the desktop application, you'll need
