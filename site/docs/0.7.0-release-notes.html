<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<p>
  This release includes support for new databases, explicit UI options
  for PostgreSQL-compatible databases, improvements to the code editor
  UX, a slight UI refresh, support for nested fields in the UI, and more!

<h3>UI refresh</h3>
<p>
  This release switches from Material Icons to Ionic fonts. More app
  state is synced to the URL so that when you reopen the app the
  sidebar remains open/closed as you left it, expanded panel details
  remain expanded, and so on.

<h3>Code editor fixes, improvements</h3>
<p>
  The last few releases have had a somewhat buggy code editor
  experience. You might have seen freezes while typing as the editor
  synced your changes to disk. This syncing freeze has been fixed in
  this release. Syncing now happens less frequently, without blocking,
  and automatically flushes when you leave the input element or run a
  panel.
</p>
<p>
  Before this release, the code editor wouldn't always resize
  correctly when nearby elements changed. This sometimes meant the
  last lines in the editor couldn't be scrolled to. This release fixes
  those issues by correctly, automatically resizing the code editor as
  needed.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, this release adds support for opening a panel in fullscreen
  mode to make it easier to focus on a particular script at a time
  with more screen real estate.

</div>
<h3>Nested fields</h3>
<p>
  Before this release you could not refer to nested fields in the
  visual transform, graph, and table panels. You'd need to add a code
  panel that extracted/flattened the nested fields first. This release
  adds direct support for accessing nested fields in these three
  panels. The only limitation is that you cannot access nested arrays
  and you cannot access a partial path that ends in an object. All
  columns must ultimately still be scalar.
</p>
<h3>Automated graph and table generation</h3>
<p>
  Now when you run a panel and it returns an array of objects, a table
  icon appears below the panel. When you click the icon, a table panel
  is generated for you that is populated from the current panel and
  includes all its columns.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, when a panel results in data with at least one string and
  number column, a button will appear in the same place that will
  generate a graph panel and run it for you.

</div>
<h3>New databases</h3>
<p>
  This release adds support for querying Cassandra (and ScyllaDB),
  FluxQL, BigQuery databases.
</p>
<h3>PostgreSQL-compatible databases</h3>
<p>
  DataStation has supported PostgreSQL since the first release.  This
  means it supported any databases that implemented the PostgreSQL
  wire protocol since the first release. But this release adds
  explicit UI options so that you don't need to know or remember that
  these databases implement the PostgreSQL wire protocol. Specifically
  there are now UI options for: TimescaleDB, CockroachDB, Yugabyte,
  CrateDB and QuestDB.
</p>
<h3>Last databases off of Node.js runner, onto Go runner</h3>
<p>
  Panel evaluation code was originally written in Node.js and was
  partially ported to Go in the 0.5.0 release. The major parts
  remaining in Node.js were support for ElasticSearch, Prometheus,
  Influx and Snowflake. This release ported all that remaining
  database code to Go. And for the first time adds integration tests
  for these four databases.
</p>
<h3>New file formats, updates to CSV parsing</h3>
<p>
  This release adds support for concatenated JSON streams. It also
  relaxes CSV parsing so panels won't error when a cell exists that
  doesn't have a corresponding header cell.
