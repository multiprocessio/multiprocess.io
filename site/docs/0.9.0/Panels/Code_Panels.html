{% raw %}<h1>Code Panels</h1>
<p>Code panels allow you to run code in a few major languages:
JavaScript, Deno, Ruby, R, Julia, Python, and in-memory SQL.</p>
<p>Like every other panel, code panels must have a result. You can set
the result using the <code class="hljs">DM_setPanel</code> function. And you can fetch another
panel's result using the <code class="hljs">DM_getPanel</code> function.</p>
<p>In-memory SQL code panels are the exception. Their result is
set automatically to the result of their SQL query. You cannot use
<code class="hljs">DM_setPanel</code> in an in-memory SQL code panel.</p>
<h1>Fetching another panel's result</h1>
<p>All code panels can grab another panel's result with the <code class="hljs">DM_getPanel</code>
function. This function takes one argument which is either the integer
index of the panel (from top to bottom starting with <code class="hljs">0</code>), or the
panel's name.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a <a href="./File_Panels.html">file panel</a> that reads a CSV
file from disk (the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/hudson-river-park-flora-plantings-beginning-1997">Hudson River Plant
dataset</a>). And
say the panel's name is <code class="hljs">Load plant data</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/multiprocessio/datastation-documentation@main/tutorials/file-plant-data.png" alt="Load plant data from CSV file" /></p>
<p>Once you have run the file panel, you can grab that data in a code
panel using <code class="hljs">DM_getPanel(&#x27;Load plant data&#x27;)</code>:</p>

<h1>Setting a panel result</h1>
<p><code class="hljs">DM_setPanel</code> sets the current panel's result. It accepts one argument. The argument must be serializable. Serialization happens automatically. Some kinds of objects that aren't serializable are circular data structures.</p>
<p>Building off the last example, the whole code panel should like like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/multiprocessio/datastation-documentation@main/tutorials/transform-plant-data.png" alt="Transform plant data" /></p>
<h2>Result format</h2>
<p>Panel results can be of any format, as long as the value is
serializable. But when setting a panel you intend to have read from a
Table, Graph, or panel that supports SQL, there is a single accepted data format.</p>
<p>Table and Graph panels can only read from a panel that formats data as
an array of objects. Each object-element must be a mapping of column
name to column value. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-json">[
  { &quot;age&quot;: 1, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Eliza&quot; },
  { &quot;age&quot;: 3, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Javier&quot; }
]
</code></pre>
<h1>Modifying the default program implementation</h1>
<p>For most languages, DataStation looks in your <code class="hljs">$PATH</code> environment
variable for an implementation of the language you pick in the code
panel. The in-memory SQL option is an exception, you don't need
anything installed to use it.</p>
<p>If an implementation by the name it looks doesn't exist, the panel
will fail with an error when you run the panel.</p>
<p>But maybe you have multiple instances of <code class="hljs">python</code> on your machine. You
can specify an absolute path you want to use for each language
implementation in settings under the &quot;Language Path Overrides&quot; section.</p>
<p>In this screenshot you can see the Deno, Julia, R, and Ruby language
paths are not absolute. They will be looked up in <code class="hljs">$PATH</code>. However,
JavaScript, PHP and Python are absolute paths that will not be looked
up in <code class="hljs">$PATH</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/multiprocessio/datastation-documentation@main/tutorials/language-path-overrides.png" alt="Language path overrides" /></p>
<p>Changes take effect the next time you run the code panel.</p>
<p>If you ever mess up these settings, you can always revert back to the
default by hitting the &quot;Reset button&quot;.</p>
<h1>Importing 3rd party libraries</h1>
<p>DataStation uses the language implementation you have already
installed on your system. This means you can import any libraries you
already have installed too.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this means that even when DataStation doesn't support a
particular API or database, you can install a language-level package
on your system so you can write your own custom code to make requests
or queries to any system.</p>
<h1>In-Memory SQL</h1>
<p>In-memory SQL is a way of running SQL queries solely against other
panels without a running database. You don't need to set up a data
source to use it. It is useful in situations where you don't have a
database but the most natural way to express a join or filter is in
SQL rather than code.</p>
<p>SQL panels can refer to the results of other panels by using
<code class="hljs">DM_getPanel($number)</code> where <code class="hljs">$number</code> is the zero-indexed panel you
want to grab. Or, like other languages, you can also refer by name
<code class="hljs">DM_getPanel(&#x27;$panelName&#x27;)</code> where <code class="hljs">$panelName</code> is the name of the
panel you want to grab.</p>
<p>The panel you refer to must have a result that is in the array of
objects format.</p>
<p>Here's an example that will fetch all results from the first panel
(zero-indexed) and filter out rows where the age column is less than
12.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-sql">SELECT * FROM DM_getPanel(0) users WHERE users.age &lt; 12
</code></pre>
