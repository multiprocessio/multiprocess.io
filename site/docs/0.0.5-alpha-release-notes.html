<h3>Multiple series support for bar and pie graphs</h3>
<p>
  You can now graph multiple series in bar charts and create nested
  pie graphs.
</p>
<h3>Panel results stored/recovered on exit</h3>
<p>
  When you run a panel, the results are now stored and recovered when
  you exit the application and comeback. This is especially useful
  when dealing with long-running scripts or queries. You don't need to
  re-run them until you want to.
</p>
<h3>Support for MS SQL Server</h3>
<p>
  You can now create SQL Server connectors and run queries against
  your SQL Server databases. Just like with all other databases you
  can connect to a local database or you can connect to a remote one
  via SSH.
</p>
<h3>Guided warnings when dependent panels have not been run</h3>
<p>
  DataStation is built around one panel pulling data from another
  panel. If a panel references another panel that hasn't been run, a
  warning will now be shown telling you that the dependent panel has
  not yet been run.
</p>
<h3>Preview widget improvements</h3>
<p>
  All tabs in the preview area are now syntax highlighted. And you can
  resize the entire area by grabbing the resize handler in the bottom
  left and dragging it left or right.
