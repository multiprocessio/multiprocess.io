<p>
  An SSH Connection is all the configuration needed to connect to a
  server running SSH. Once a connection is set up, it can be used
  in <a href="/docs/file-panel.html">File
  panels</a>, <a href="/docs/http-panel.html">HTTP panels</a>,
  and <a href="/docs/sql-panel.html">SQL panels</a> to access remote
  data that you wouldn't otherwise be able to.
