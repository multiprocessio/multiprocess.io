<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<h3>Query Elasticsearch, Influx, and Prometheus databases</h3>
<p>
  In addition to existing support for every major OLTP SQL database and
  a few analytics databases, you can now query Elasticsearch, Influx,
  and Prometheus databases.

<h3>Filter by time range and group by time window in Visual Transform panel</h3>
<p>
  In addition to generic SQL filters you can now visually filter by
  time range. At the moment, the field you're filtering on must be in
  ISO8601/RFC3339 format. In the future, DataStation will be able to
  guess and standardize time formats on ingestion. For now you'll have
  to do any standardization yourself.
</p>
<p>
  When selecting an aggregation method you can also group over a time
  window. The field has the same restrictions as above, it must be in
  ISO8601/RFC3339 format.

<h3>All panels are cancellable</h3>
<p>
  Until now, all panel evaluation happened in the same process as
  the Electron app or server app. Program panels were the only
  exception since they run a subprocess with the language you
  selected.
</p>
<p>
  But in this release, all panel evaluation happens in a
  subprocess. This means all resources (open connections, SSH tunnels,
  etc.) are guaranteed to be cleaned up when you hit Cancel on a
  running panel.
</p>
<p>
  It is especially useful to be able to kill unexpectedly long-running
  queries.
</p>
<h3>Support for DM_getPanel() calls in MySQL and PostgreSQL queries</h3>
<p>
  Until now, only SQLite panels could call DM_getPanel() to import data from another panel. Now you can do the same when querying MySQL or PostgreSQL databases. It works by creating a temporary table and ingesting the requested panel's results. Thus you can use a panel's results in exactly the same way as.
</p>
<h3>Improvements to testing</h3>
<p>
  This release takes DataStation tests from 24% statement/line
  coverage to 66%. All programming languages are integration tested
  and all major open source SQL databases are now integration tested
  as well.
</p>
<p>
  This release also involved moving
  from <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/spectron">Spectron</a>
  to <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/using-selenium-and-webdriver">Selenium</a>
  since Spectron is no longer maintained and doesn't support recent
  versions of Electron.
</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Re-running a panel no longer discards the previous run's Preview and Metadata display while waiting for the new run to complete</li>
  <li>Performance improvements and correctness fixes for large objects in "Inferred schema" calculation</li>
  <li>Stack traces on error now properly show original error (they were being masked by bad logic)</li>
  <li>The Visual Transform panel now properly quotes all field names coming from the panel source</li>
</ul>
