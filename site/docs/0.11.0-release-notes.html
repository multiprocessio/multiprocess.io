<h3>Easier log analysis in SQL with a standard library for SQLite in Go</h3>
<p>
  This release brings an entire standard library of string, regexp,
  math, url parsing, best-effort date parsing, statistical
  aggregation, and hashing/encoding functions to the SQL code panel
  (and to dsq). This addition makes it much easier to analyse
  arbitrary data with less code. SQL code panels (and SQLite database
  panels) now autocomplete all of these new functions and all
  functions built into SQLite.
</p>
<p>
  This release upgrades the "download panel results" feature, adding
  more formats and copy-to-clipboard. It also adds formatting support
  for SQL panels, and other UX improvements. And it improves in-app
  onboarding and provides sample data and sample projects for folks
  who want a quick tour.

<h2>A standard library for SQL code panels</h2>
<p>
  Taking a step back for a second, DataStation allows you to query
  many kinds of databases. But it also allows you to script with
  code. One of the options for scripting with code is an in-app SQL
  system. This system is based on SQLite. Being able to script with
  SQL makes some kinds of transformations and joins very easy.
</p>
<p>
  But until now you could only do so as long as
  your data was already in a format you wanted. SQL code panels use
  SQLite under the hood and SQLite has relatively few builtin
  functions.
</p>
<p>
  So I recently built and
  open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/go-sqlite3-stdlib">go-sqlite3-stdlib</a>,
  a collection of libraries for use in DataStation, dsq, and any other
  Go programs using SQLite.
</p>
<p>
  Here are a few screenshots of the docs for the new
  functions. Screenshots because this release announcement is not the
  authority,
  the <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/go-sqlite3-stdlib">go-sqlite3-stdlib</a>
  repo is the authority.
</p>
<div class="pb-4">
  <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/go-sqlite3-stdlib#strings">Read the string function docs</a>
  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.11.0-stdlib-strings.png" alt="SQL standard library: string functions" />
</div>
<div class="pb-4">
  <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/go-sqlite3-stdlib#aggregation">Read the aggregation function docs</a>
  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.11.0-stdlib-aggregation.png" alt="SQL standard library: aggregation functions" />
</div>
<div class="pb-4">
  <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/go-sqlite3-stdlib#net">Read the URL-manipulation function docs</a>
  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.11.0-stdlib-url.png" alt="SQL standard library: url manipulation" />
</div>
<div class="pb-4">
  <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/go-sqlite3-stdlib#date">Read the best-effort date manipulation function docs</a>
  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.11.0-stdlib-date.png" alt="SQL standard library: date manipulation" />
</div>
<div class="pb-4">
  <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/go-sqlite3-stdlib#math">Read the math function docs</a>
  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.11.0-stdlib-math.png" alt="SQL standard library: math functions" />

<div class="pb-4">

  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.11.0-stdlib-encoding.png" alt="SQL standard library: hashing/encoding functions" />
</div>
<p>
  This is particularly useful for enabling SQL analysis of logs in
  DataStation. In fact, there's even a new sample project included
  with DataStation (you'll read more about this below) that
  demonstrates SQL analysis of nginx logs.

</div>
<p>
  The code editor in DataStation also autocompletes all of these
  functions and all builtin SQLite ones. But you can
  always <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/go-sqlite3-stdlib">read
  the docs</a> if you'd prefer.

<h2>Download, copy-to-clipboard</h2>
<p>
  Before this release, downloading a panel created a CSV or JSON file
  depending on if the panel result was table-like. In this release you
  now have the option to export to CSV, JSON, HTML Table or Markdown
  Table. And you can copy to clipboard instead of downloading if you
  know you're just going to paste the result somewhere (like a blog
  post).
</p>
<p>
  Just remember, the tabular data formats will only be an option if
  the panel result is an array of objects.
</p>
<div class="pb-4">
  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.11.0-export-result.png" alt="Exporting results" />
</div>
<h2>SQL Formatting</h2>
<p>
  This release brings support for reformatting SQL code. In the future
  this formatting ability will be extended to all code types. For now,
  just SQL.
</p>
<div class="pb-4">
  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.11.0-format.gif" alt="Formatting SQL" />
</div>
<h2>In-app onboarding</h2>
<p>
  When you create a new project, you will now how the option to pick
  from an existing template that uses sample data bundled in with the
  DataStation install. These are to help new folks try out parts of
  DataStation easily without needing to bring any of their own data
  yet.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: on macOS you will need to copy DataStation into some permanent
  directory like Applications otherwise macOS appears to put
  DataStation in a read-only directory that messes with loading bundled
  sample data.
</p>
<div class="pb-4">
  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.11.0-templates.png" alt="Templates" />
</div>
<p>
  And when you create a new blank project, the empty project will contain
  links to tutorials and also an embedded video showing some of
  DataStation.
</p>
<div class="pb-4">
  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.11.0-blank.png" alt="Blank project" />
</div>
<p>
  There is also now a new Help tab in the navigation sidebar, and
  associated page.
</p>
<div class="pb-4">
  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.11.0-help.png" alt="Blank project" />
</div>
<h2>Misc</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Changes to standard HTML input elements now only take effect onblur;
    that is, when you click away from the input or switch tabs/windows.
  </li>
  <li>
    File panels now run automatically on change similar to tables and
    graph panels.
  </li>
  <li>
    File and HTTP panels now recognized .xslm as an Excel file
    extension.
  </li>
</ul>
