<p>
  DataStation is a data IDE for developers. It allows you to easily
  pull data from SQL, HTTP APIs, and files (CSV, Parquet, Excel, nginx
  access logs, syslog, etc.); script against these files (in Python,
  JavaScript, Ruby, R, or Julia); and generate beautiful graphs. All
  in one application.
</p>
<p>
  This release adds a number of features, bug fixes, and usability improvements.
</p>
<h3>Query Snowflake, Clickhouse, and Oracle databases</h3>
<p>
  In addition to existig support for SQLite, PostgreSQL, MS SQL
  Server, and MySQL compatible databases; you can now also query
  Oracle, Snowflake, and Clickhouse databases.

<h3>Filter, group, sort, and limit without code using the new Visual Transform panel</h3>
<p>
  Having code panels to facilitate all kinds of data transformations
  is awesome. But for the simple tasks, setting up the code is a
  hasle. The Visual Transform panel allows you to click to filter,
  group, sort, and limit against another panel. This makes it even
  faster to get basic projects set up.

</p>
<p>
  Since Visual Transform panels are panels like any other, you can
  stack Visual Transform panels or read them from Code panels and so
  on.
</p>
<h3>Encrypted credentials</h3>
<p>
  This release now automatically generates a signing key on
  install. It is unique to your computer. It is used to encrypt and
  decrypt database and SSH passwords as needed. Under the hood
  DataStation uses the <a href="https://tweetnacl.js.org/#/">TweetNaCL
    library</a>.
</p>
<h3>Server mode with openid-connect authentication</h3>
<p>
  One of the most exciting things happening in DataStation right now
  is the option to run it on a server. Not only does this make it
  easier to share code and data with other people, it also makes it
  possible for DataStation to support recurring, scheduled runs and
  exports of projects.
