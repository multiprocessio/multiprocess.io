<p>
  Database panels allow you to write queries against databases. Supported
  databases include PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite,
  Oracle, and SQL Server. After you pick a SQL vendor, you will pick
  from <a href="/docs/data-source.html">Data Sources</a> that are
  filled out in the sidebar.
</p>
<h2>With Server</h2>
<p>
  Queries can be proxied through an SSH tunnel by checking
  the <code>With Server</code> option. Once selected, you will be
  prompted to pick from one of the SSH Connections you set up
  previously.
</p>
<h2>Oracle</h2>
<p>
  Oracle requires an additional setup step. You must download
  the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/winx64-64-downloads.html">instant
  client</a> from their site and unzip it. Add the enclosed directory
  to your <code>$PATH</code> environment variable and restart
  DataStation.
