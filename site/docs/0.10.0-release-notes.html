<p>
  Happy May! This release of DataStation improved support for viewing
  data in table panels, improved support for Elasticsearch, Google
  Sheets support, DataStation Server available for testing, and other
  fixes and UX improvements.

<h2>Table panel updates</h2>
<p>
  This release brings pagination to table panels. Every table panel is
  paginated automatically and you can pick a few table sizes. This
  allows DataStation to handle rendering millions of rows. Before this
  release the app would simply crash when rendering too big a data
  source in a table panel. Additionally, it would fail to render at
  all (not yet able to crash) when the data source was over 4GB. Now
  the max effective size should be infinite.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, this release brings better support for rendering data
  that differs row-by-row. When pulling data from most databases or
  some strictly-typed file formats there is no variation
  row-by-row. In other formats like JSON each row can be completely
  different. Before this release viewing a table with varied row data
  could crash DataStation. In this release varied data is handled and
  simply stringified. If a cell has no value then it is rendered with
  a special <code>(Empty)</code> marker.
</p>

<h2>Elasticsearch updates</h2>
<p>
  The bad news is that before this release, you could fetch at most 10
  rows of data from Elasticsearch. The good news is that now there's
  no such limitation. :) I guess at some point I forgot to implement
  pagination logic. With this release DataStation will happily ingest
  hundreds of thousands of rows of Elasticsearch data.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, you can now disable SSL validation when querying
  Elasticsearch. The better choice would be to add a custom CA
  certificate in the DataStation settings page but disabling SSL
  validation is sometimes more convenient in the short-term. This
  option is also available in this release for HTTP panels as well.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: Elasticsearch connections don't seem to work over SSH
  connections in DataStation. You can instead run <code>ssh
  -L9200:localhost:9200 your-es-server.your-domain.com</code> and then
  query <code>localhost:9200</code> in the meantime.

</div>
<h2>Google Sheets</h2>
<p>
  This release adds support for fetching data from Google Sheets. The
  sheet must have a header row of labels like a CSV file.
</p>

</div>
<h2>Self-hosted DataStation Server</h2>
<p>
  DataStation Server allows you to run DataStation on an x86_64 Linux
  server. All code/query evaluation happens on the server, not your
  laptop. You view the UI in your browser. It's a web app. It is
  self-hosted only for now.
</p>
<p>
  To clarify the difference between the existing desktop app and this
  new web app, the desktop app has been renamed from DataStation
  Community Edition to DataStation Desktop CE. The web app is called
  DataStation Server CE.
</p>
<p>
  The server supports OpenID for authentication but no per-user access system. I've been
  running an instance of DataStation Server for internal analytics for
  months now but the install process is early stages. Try it out if
  you're interested and report bugs on Discord or Github.
</p>
<p>
  An upcoming release will bring 1) support for developing read-only
  dashboards hosted on the server and 2) support for setting up
  recurring runs and email exports of panels. These features will only
  be available in DataStation Server, not DataStation Desktop.
