<p>
  Happy April! This release of DataStation brings an improved data
  storage layer, support for basic autocomplete, and a number of UX
  improvements and bug fixes. There's also a small preview of an
  upcoming Enterprise Edition.
</p>
<p>
  Check out this short demo of this release that connects to a
  CockroachDB instance, runs a basic query, and loads the results into
  a Pandas dataframe in Python for some exploration.

<h2>Improved storage layer</h2>
<p>
  The name sounds boring but this is actually a really big
  deal. Before this release all project state was stored in a single
  JSON blob that was sent on every request from the UI (with the
  exception of encrypted passwords).
</p>
<p>
  Anyone familiar with API design recognizes this as a horrible
  model. It helped DataStation get this far but has too many chances
  for bugs and poor performance. In fact a number of bugs had been
  reported that were directly attribute to this storage method.
</p>
<p>
  This release moves to an API-driven storage model where only
  individual entities are sent back on edit (e.g. the panel, connector, ssh
  server being edited). Additionally it moves from JSON to storing
  project data in a local SQLite file.
</p>
<p>
  The good news is that the migration is done and well covered by
  automatic and manual testing. The bad news is that any migration
  like this can have bugs. DataStation automatically copies your
  existing JSON project file to a new file with a .bak suffix so you
  can recover your old data if the migration fails.
</p>
<p>
  If you see bugs when running this new version please report them
  on <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/issues">Github
  or <a href="https://discord.multiprocess.io">Discord</a>! Although
  since this is a one-time migration the main recourse will be to help
  you get a valid SQLite version of your existing JSON project file.
</p>
<h2>Updated navigation</h2>
<p>
  This release rearranges navigation slightly, adding a global sidebar
  to switch between the editor, dashboard, exports, and settings
  views. This has an important ramification for dashboards and
  exports; mainly that both will no longer be tied to a specific page
  in a project. When you use the server mode (which is still in
  testing) you will be able to put panels onto a dashboard from any
  page in the project.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, this new navigation makes it easier to access settings
  in desktop mode. And when you make changes in settings you'll no
  longer need to restart DataStation for the changes to take effect.

<h2>Autocomplete</h2>
<p>
  This release introduces very basic support for
  autocomplete. Autocomplete is now provided for panel names (for use
  when referencing panels with `DM_getPanel`) and panel result field
  names. Autocomplete is not yet provided for table names and columns
  when querying a database. The goal is definitely to do so
  eventually.
</p>
<p>
  It's possible there are bugs in the autocomplete code that prevent
  you from editing anything at all. In that case you can disable
  autocomplete on the settings page.

<h2>Runner improvements</h2>
<p>
  First-time contributor and first-time Go
  coder, <a href="https://github.com/fritzgrabo">Fritz</a>,
  contributed two fixes to the DataStation runner code. The first
  was <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/pull/205">an
  improvement to DataStation's shape detection library</a>. The second
  was
  to <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/pull/209">increase
  the size of lines the runner can handle when reading JSON newline
  files</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you so much, Fritz!
</p>
<h2>Misc UI improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    New panel creation requires you to pick a panel type, you can't edit panel type after creating a panel
    <div class="pb-4">

    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Stdout/Stderr section fixed (and tests added, finally); indicator appears when Stdout/Stderr is not empty
    <div class="pb-4">
      <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.9.0-stderr.png" alt="DataStation stdout/stderr" />
    </div>

    Dark-mode is a little less blue/purple
    <div class="pb-4">
      <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.9.0-dark.png" alt="DataStation dark mode" />
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Ctrl-tab and Ctrl-shift-tab switch between pages in desktop mode</li>
  <li>Double clicking on a panel header toggles between panel fullscreen/regular size</li>
  <li>New panels, database connectors, and ssh servers all start expanded when created</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enterprise Edition, Change History</h2>
<p>
  As you build bigger workflows and reports with DataStation it
  becomes more important to be able to see the changes that you've
  made and be able to go backward. So the first paid-only feature is a
  full history of all changes made within DataStation.
</p>
<p>
  This paid edition is not yet publicly available but if you're
  interested in being first to try it
  out, <a href="mailto:phil@multiprocess.io">get in touch</a>.
