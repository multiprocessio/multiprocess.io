<p>
  There are three big parts
  of <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/releases/tag/0.0.3-alpha">this
  release</a>: support for proxying certain panels through an SSH
  server, support for three new scripting languages, and usability
  improvements when working with many megabytes of data.
</p>
<h2>New features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    You can now <strong>proxy SQL and HTTP requests through an SSH
    server</strong>. This makes it more practical to use DataStation
    to connect to production systems. Read more in
    the <a href="/docs/http-panel.html">HTTP panel</a>
    and <a href="/docs/sql-panel.html">SQL panel</a> documentation.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can now <strong>read remote files by attaching an SSH server
    to a File panel</strong>. This is useful for pulling server logs
    into DataStation. Read more in
    the <a href="/docs/file-panel.html">File panel</a> documentation.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can now <strong>script in Code panels using Ruby, Julia, and
    R</strong> in addition to Python and JavaScript. Read more in
    the <a href="/docs/code-panel.html">Code panel</a> documentation.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    You can now easily load tens of megabytes worth of data in
    DataStation due to an improved algorithm for showing panel result
    previews.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Table panel is easier to read due to alternate row coloring
    and column alignment.
  </li>
  <li>
    The default MySQL port when not specified is correctly set to
    3306.
  </li>
  <li>
    Correctly change UI when a panel is being run to show that
    evaluation is happening.
  </li>
</ul>
