<h2>SSH Connections</h2>
<p>An SSH connection is all the configuration needed to connect to a
server running SSH. Once a connection is set up, it can be used in
File panels, HTTP panels, and SQL panels to access remote data that
you wouldn't otherwise be able to.</p>
<p>You can connect using either a username/password combination or an SSH
private key file.</p>
