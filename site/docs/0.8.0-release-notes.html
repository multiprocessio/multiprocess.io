<p>
  This release includes support for macros pulling panel results in
  any panel type (not just panels that
  support <code>DM_getPanel</code> functions), support for querying
  Airtable and AWS Athena, support for graphing with unique lines for
  each unique element, and more!

<p>
  This release also
  has <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/pull/195">the
  largest contributions</a> made by someone other than myself, support
  for loading Apache ORC files.
</p>
<h3>Macros</h3>
<p>
  Before this release, only code panels and MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite
  panels could refer to other panel results
  using <code>DM_getPanel()</code> calls. With this release though all
  panel contents are run through a Jinja-like macro expander
  (<a href="https://github.com/flosch/pongo2">pongo2</a>,
  specifically) that allows you to reference other panel results.
</p>
<p>
  For example, you can now upload a panel result to an HTTP server by
  entering <code>{{'{{ DM_getPanel("0") | json }}'}}</code></pre> as
  an HTTP panel's content.

  <img class="no-shadow" src="/0.8.0-http-macro.gif" alt="DataStation" />
</div>
<p>
  Note: unlike the non-macro version, the argument
  to <code>DM_getPanel</code> must be a string. The value can still be
  the panel's position or the panel's name.
</p>
<p>
  Another way macros can be used is for passing data between
  completely different kinds of data sources. For example, let's say
  you want to filter ElasticSearch logs based on a certain kind of
  customer. Your SQL panel and query might be something
  like <code>SELECT id FROM customers WHERE type ='x'</code>. Then
  your ElasticSearch panel filter might be <code>req.params.customer_id IN ({{'{% for row in DM_getPanel("0") %}{{ row.id }}{% if not forloop.Last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}'}})</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Macros can be used in every kind of panel, including code panels and
  database panels that already supported <code>DM_getPanel()</code>
  calls without macros. In those cases the existing
  non-macro <code>DM_getPanel()</code> is more efficient.
</p>
<h3>Airtable and AWS Athena</h3>
<p>
  You can now fetch data from Airtable with or without filters. And
  you can query AWS Athena. A tutorial for interacting with Airtable
  in DataStation
  is <a href="/docs/tutorials/Query_Airtable_with_DataStation.html">available
  here</a>. And <a href="/docs/tutorials/Query_AWS_Athena_with_DataStation.html">here</a>
  is a tutorial for querying AWS Athena.

<h3>Graphing unique entities</h3>
<p>
  Before this release it was possible to graph multiple lines but
  where the multiple lines corresponded to entire columns. In this
  release it's now possible to generate graphs with multiple lines
  based on a unique values in the column being graphed.
</p>
<p>
  You might use this feature, for example, if you are trying to show
  traffic by unique IP over time and you want to graph each unique IP
  traffic over time, one line for each unique IP.
</p>

<h3>Apache ORC</h3>
<p>
  This release adds support for loading Apache ORC files. This feature
  was implemented by
  a <a href="https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation/commits?author=gl28">first-time
  OSS contributor</a>!
</p>
<h3>SQL queries on nested arrays</h3>
<p>
  Before this release, you couldn't run <code>DM_getPanel()</code> in
  a database panel if the panel you wanted to reference was not an
  array of objects. With this release you can pass a second parameter
  which is a "path" to a nested array within the panel's result.
</p>
<p>
  For example if a panel returns <code>{"data": [{"a": 1}, {"b":
  2}]}</code>, you can now run a SQL query on that: <code>SELECT *
  FROM DM_getPanel('0', 'data')</code> and it will return <code>[{"a": 1,
  "b": null}, {"b": 2, "a": null}]</code>.
</p>
<h3>Automatic visual panel evaluation</h3>
<p>
  In this release, visual panels are re-run automatically when their
  settings changed *and* when their dependent panel changes. In normal
  circumstances you should not need to run a graph or table panel
  manually any more.
</p>
<h3>Custom CA certificates</h3>
<p>
  Now inside of settings you can add a custom CA certificate. This
  certificate is automatically tried in all HTTPS requests.
