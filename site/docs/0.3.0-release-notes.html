<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<h3>Server Mode</h3>
<p>
  It is now fully supported and documentation to run DataStation as a
  server application. This is useful if you frequently switch devices
  or if you are working on a team. The projects you edit on the server
  can be shared/viewed/edited by the entire team.
</p>
<p>
  To run the server mode, you will need a PostgreSQL database and an OIDC-compatible
  authentication service such as Google Accounts. The install steps
  and provided script are for systems that use systemd (so recent
  Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, Amazon Linux, etc.) but you could
  manually adjust the steps for running in a containerized
  environment. Read
  the <a href="/docs/0.3.0/Installation.html">install guide</a> for
  complete details.
</p>
<h2>Read-Only Dashboards</h2>
<p>
  <strong>When running the server</strong> there is now a tab for
  showing all graphs and tables for the page in read-only mode. This
  makes it easy for you to share the results of an exploration with
  folks who may not want to make modifications. In the future there
  will be a concept of user permissions where some users will only be
  able to view the dashboard tab and not make edits to the project.

<h2>Scheduled Recurring Email Exports</h2>
<p>
  <strong>When running the server</strong> there is now a tab for
  scheduling daily, weekly, or monthly runs of a project page Every
  day, week, or month the entire page is reevaluated from top to
  bottom. All graph and table panels on that page are sent as an HTML
  email to the recipients of your choice. You will need to configure
  an SMTP server for this to work.

<h2>Misc Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can now configure the display width of graphs to improve readability</li>
  <li>You can now refer to the results of other panels by panel name (e.g. <code>prev = DM_getPanel('fetch csv results')</code>)</li>
  <li>All panel details are collapsible</li>
  <li>You can toggle between unique colors or one color in graph mode</li>
  <li>You can now create line graphs in addition to bar graphs and pie charts</li>
  <li>Panels run significantly faster by lazily loading code for evaluation during each run</li>
</ul>
