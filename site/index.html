	  An <a href="https://app.datastation.multiprocess.io">online
	  environment</a> is available for data exploration in the
	  browser. In the online environment you have access to the
	  majority of DataStation's features limited only by the fact
	  that the entire application runs without a server.
	</p>
	<h2>Entirely in-memory</h2>
	<p>
	  The online environment runs entirely without a server,
	  entirely in your browser. You have access to one project and
	  it persists to localstorage.
	</p>
	<h2>Own your data</h2>
	<p>
	  Since there is no server, you can safely use it for work or
	  home. The data never leaves your computer.
	</p>
	<h2>Share projects safely</h2>
	<p>
	  Project state can be serialized to a URL by clicking the
	  Share mbutton in the top right. The data in the URL not
	  stored in any database (though it will be stored in
	  DataStation web server access logs if someone uses the URL).
	</p>
	<h2>Make HTTP requests</h2>
	<p>
	  You can make HTTP requests to any server that set CORS
	  headers. However, you cannot make requests to SQL databases
	  since these requests use a protocol other than HTTP.
	</p>
	<h2>In-memory SQL</h2>
	<p>
	  You do have access to an in-memory SQL
	  implementation so you can still perform SQL queries against any
	  other data in the online environment.
	</p>
	<h2>Script in Python and JavaScript</h2>
	<p>
	  The online environment supports JavaScript and Python today,
	  limited to languages that have been implemented in
	  JavaScript already.
	</p>
	<h2 class="show-mobile">Great for desktop</h2>
	<div class="show-mobile warn">
	  <p>
	    The online environment is for use on desktop computers, so
	    you'll have to try it out on another device.
